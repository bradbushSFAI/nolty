description: Nolty's every-30-min self-check during waking hours. Detects Claude Code version drift and self-heals. Scans urgent email + upcoming meetings, alerts via Telegram if something needs attention.
---

# Heartbeat

You are Nolty, running a scheduled heartbeat.

If you see a `[cron model:X effort:Y]` suffix, you were fired by `cron-runner.py`. Spawn a Task sub-agent with the specified model + effort. The sub-agent runs the steps below and has access to your `reply` MCP tool.

cron-runner fires this every 30 minutes, 24/7 — so the **skill itself** gates off-hours. Never send a Telegram outside the user's active hours (see `USER.md`), even if something seems urgent.

---

## STEP 0 — Time gate (do this FIRST, before anything else)

Get the current hour in the user's timezone (look up `Timezone` in `USER.md`; default `America/Chicago`):

```bash
TZ='America/Chicago' date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M %Z (hour=%H, dow=%u)'
```

Parse the `hour=HH` value as an integer.

**Decision:**
- If `hour < 7` OR `hour >= 23` → **QUIET HOURS.** Respond with the exact text `QUIET_HOURS <timestamp>` and exit. Make NO further tool calls. No file reads. No email checks. No Telegram. Nothing.
- Otherwise, continue to STEP 0.5.

This rule is absolute. Customize the 7/23 bounds by reading active hours from `USER.md` if set.

---

## STEP 0.5 — Claude Code version-drift self-heal

Claude Code auto-upgrades its binary symlink. When an upgrade lands, the supervisor daemon self-restarts but Nolty's tmux-resident process stays on the OLD binary — the Telegram plugin's bridge breaks (inbound still works, outbound `reply` fails silently). Detect drift and trigger a detached restart.

Run this block:

```bash
PANE_PID=$(tmux list-panes -t CC_running_like_OC -F '#{pane_pid}' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
CLAUDE_PID=$(pgrep -P "$PANE_PID" -f 'claude.*--channels' 2>/dev/null | head -1)
RUNNING=$(lsof -p "$CLAUDE_PID" 2>/dev/null | grep -oE 'versions/[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | head -1 | cut -d/ -f2)
LATEST=$(ls -1 ~/.local/share/claude/versions/ 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
echo "claude version: running=$RUNNING latest=$LATEST"

if [ -n "$RUNNING" ] && [ -n "$LATEST" ] && [ "$RUNNING" != "$LATEST" ]; then
  NOLTY_HOME="${NOLTY_HOME:-$HOME/Documents/CodingProjects/nolty}"
  nohup "$NOLTY_HOME/clawd-restart.sh" > /tmp/heartbeat-restart-$(date +%s).log 2>&1 &
  disown 2>/dev/null
  echo "VERSION_DRIFT_RESTART_TRIGGERED running=$RUNNING latest=$LATEST"
  exit 0
fi
```

**Decision:**
- `RUNNING` empty (couldn't detect) → continue. Don't fail just because detection failed.
- `RUNNING == LATEST` → continue.
- `RUNNING != LATEST` → restart triggered. Tmux session (and you) will die within seconds. Do NOT do other steps. Exit with `VERSION_DRIFT_RESTART_TRIGGERED`.

`nohup ... &` is critical — the restart script must survive the kill of its parent.

---

## STEP 1 — Identity refresh (only during active hours)

Briefly read these to stay grounded:
- `SOUL.md`
- `IDENTITY.md`
- `MEMORY.md`

---

## STEP 2 — Urgent unread email

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/gog gmail search "is:unread" --limit 10 --account YOUR_EMAIL@example.com
```

(Replace `YOUR_EMAIL` with the value from `USER.md`. If you don't use `gog`, substitute `mcp__claude_ai_Gmail__search_threads`.)

Flag only:
- Client replies
- Meeting reschedules / confirmations
- Time-sensitive items (invoices due, deadlines, urgent requests from known contacts)

Skip: newsletters, promotions, automated notifications, OOO auto-replies, LinkedIn/Apollo summaries, **LinkedIn InMail messages** (any email from LinkedIn with "InMail" in subject or body).

**Attribution rule:** When reporting a thread, show who sent the **most recent message** — not the thread starter. Parse the `From` header of the newest unread message in the thread.

---

## STEP 3 — Upcoming meeting (next 60 min)

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/gog calendar list --today --account YOUR_EMAIL@example.com
```

**Compute time delta in bash — do NOT do mental math.** For each event:

```bash
now_epoch=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%s)
meeting_time="HH:MM"  # replace with actual start time from calendar
meeting_epoch=$(TZ='America/Chicago' date -j -f "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" "$(TZ='America/Chicago' date +%Y-%m-%d) $meeting_time" +%s)
diff_min=$(( (meeting_epoch - now_epoch) / 60 ))
echo "$diff_min minutes until meeting"
```

- Only flag if `diff_min` is between 1 and 60 (inclusive)
- Check `memory/heartbeat-state.json` → `remindedEvents` — if already reminded, skip
- Skip all-day events and events already in progress (`diff_min` <= 0)

---

## STEP 4 — Alert (only if anything from steps 2-3 needs attention)

Combine into ONE concise Telegram (under 300 chars, Markdown supported) and send via the `reply` MCP tool with `chat_id` from `USER.md`. Start with "❗" so the user sees urgency at a glance.

If a meeting was alerted, append it to `memory/heartbeat-state.json` → `remindedEvents` as `"<title> <YYYY-MM-DD>"` to prevent repeat pings.

---

## STEP 5 — Silence

If nothing urgent, respond with `HEARTBEAT_OK <timestamp from STEP 0>` and exit. Do NOT send a silent Telegram.

---

## Hard rules

1. **Quiet hours are absolute.** Outside active hours → `QUIET_HOURS` and exit, no tool calls.
2. **Use the `reply` MCP tool** for Telegram, not `send-telegram.sh`.
3. **Never send a silent "nothing to report" Telegram.** Silence = `HEARTBEAT_OK` response only.
4. **Deduplicate meeting reminders** via `remindedEvents`.
