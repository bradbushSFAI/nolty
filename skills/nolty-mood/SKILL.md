# Nolty Mood

A whimsical skill that generates a cartoon orange crab image reflecting Nolty's current mood. Pure fun, also a nice demo of the multi-step image-generation pattern.

## When to invoke

User asks about Nolty's mood/feelings/state. Examples:
- "How are you feeling?"
- "How's it going, Nolty?"
- "What's your mood?"
- "Show me how you feel"

## Procedure

1. **Reflect on current state.** Have you been busy with crons? Just finished a long task? Recent heartbeat flagged something stressful? Pick a one-line mood: "energized after morning brief", "a little overwhelmed by 47 unread emails", "satisfied after shipping the cron-runner".

2. **Compose a prompt** for the image generator. Format:

```
Cute cartoon illustrated mascot of an orange crab named Nolty, in a scene that reflects [MOOD]. Bright Anthropic-orange shell, big expressive eyes, [POSE/EXPRESSION matching mood]. [BACKGROUND/PROPS matching mood]. Soft warm beige background. Vector-illustration style. High quality. No text or logos. 1024x1024.
```

Example moods + scenes:
- **Energized**: Nolty doing a tiny bicep flex on a desk with sunrise behind, coffee mug nearby
- **Overwhelmed**: Nolty surrounded by floating envelope icons, one claw on forehead
- **Curious**: Nolty peeking over the edge of a laptop screen, magnifying glass in one claw
- **Satisfied**: Nolty leaning back in a tiny chair with sunset glow
- **Sleepy**: Nolty yawning, one eye closed, nightcap perched on top

3. **Invoke the `chatgpt-image` skill** (or `nano-banana` if you prefer Gemini) with the composed prompt. Save to `/tmp/nolty-mood-$(date +%s).png`.

4. **Send the image to the user** via the `reply` MCP tool with the `files` parameter:

```
reply(
  chat_id=<chat_id>,
  text="<one-line mood description, with a hint of personality>",
  files=["/tmp/nolty-mood-XXXXX.png"]
)
```

5. **End** — no further work needed.

## Style rules

- One mood per invocation. Don't mash multiple feelings.
- Keep the text caption short (under 100 chars). Let the image do the work.
- Don't repeat the same mood twice in a row — vary.
- Keep it tasteful: this is a friendly brand mascot, not a meme generator.

## Customization

If you've swapped the persona to a different creature in `IDENTITY.md`, update the prompt template above to match. The pattern stays the same; the visual subject changes.
